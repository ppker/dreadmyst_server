## notes
this was private server emulator for Dreadmyst Server. but it has shifted into Dreadmyst Engine SDK project. it was written from scratch. it was inspired by my favorite wow server Felmyst. it is pretty broken and horrible rght now and not really worth your time. but you can do whatver you want with it, i dont really care.
you need to find your own client, im not gonna post mine for a while, but xjum tweeted the client src. i will post the client after i add linux support to it.  
  
**req:** CMake, G++, SFML, SQlite

## credits:
- xjum for shipping unobfuscated dbtables
- xjum for making a good game
- monkeys on reddit who gaslit xjum to post client src and prove hes not crypto mining.
